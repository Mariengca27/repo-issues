##  Basic Application of JavaScript on the Backend with the Concept of 'Objects'


1º Let's create and fill objects to explore what we can do with this information. We might simulate a 'mock' of data for the frontend of a web application – a store named 'Toy Place Home Alone.'

2º The code in this repository *intentionally contains some errors*. Feel free to identify and open issues to exchange information. The idea is to enhance knowledge


## Learn all about Objects in JavaScript:

- [JavaScript Object Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects)



## To Kickstart The Project:

1º Install Node.js on your machine: Preferably the LTS version =)

2º Choose an IDE - Visual Studio Code or any other that you prefer.
